 problem:
 Design a max stack that supports push, pop, top, peekMax and popMax.

 push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
 pop() -- Remove the element on top of the stack and return it.
 top() -- Get the element on the top.
 peekMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack.
 popMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack, and remove it. If you find more than one maximum elements, only remove the top-most one.
 Example 1:

 MaxStack stack = new MaxStack();
 stack.push(5);
 stack.push(1);
 stack.push(5);
 stack.top(); -> 5
 stack.popMax(); -> 5
 stack.top(); -> 1
 stack.peekMax(); -> 5
 stack.pop(); -> 1
 stack.top(); -> 5
 Note: -1e7 <= x <= 1e7 Number of operations won't exceed 10000. The last four operations won't be called when stack is empty.

 explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx5Sw9130L0&list=PLot-Xpze53letfIu9dMzIIO7na_sqvl0w&index=5
 primary idea:
 - Use stack and as soon as the current height is lower than earlier, pop all last height's in stack which are higher than current one. calculate area and modify maxArea if needed. After Iteration, check if stack is empty. if not calculate maxArea with all stack elementss

/*
 Given a string representing arbitrarily nested ternary expressions, calculate the result of the expression. You can always assume that the given expression is valid and only consists of digits 0-9, ?, :, T and F (T and F represent True and False respectively).
 
 Note:
 The length of the given string is â‰¤ 10000.
 Each number will contain only one digit.
 The conditional expressions group right-to-left (as usual in most languages).
 The condition will always be either T or F. That is, the condition will never be a digit.
 The result of the expression will always evaluate to either a digit 0-9, T or F.
 
 
 Example 1:
 Input: "T?2:3"

 Output: "2"

 Explanation: If true, then result is 2; otherwise result is 3.
 
 
 Example 2:
 Input: "F?1:T?4:5"

 Output: "4"

 Explanation: The conditional expressions group right-to-left. Using parenthesis, it is read/evaluated as:

              "(F ? 1 : (T ? 4 : 5))"                   "(F ? 1 : (T ? 4 : 5))"

 Example 3:
 Input: "T?T?F:5:3"

 Explanation: The conditional expressions group right-to-left. Using parenthesis, it is read/evaluated as:

 problem:
 Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

 The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to today's price.

 For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100,80,60,70,60,75,85], then the stock spans would be [1,1,1,2,1,4,6].
 Implement the StockSpanner class:

 StockSpanner() Initializes the object of the class.
 int next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.
 
 Testcases:
 Input
 ["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
 [[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
 Output
 [null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

 Explanation
 StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();
 stockSpanner.next(100); // return 1
 stockSpanner.next(80);  // return 1
 stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
 stockSpanner.next(70);  // return 2
 stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
 stockSpanner.next(75);  // return 4, because the last 4 prices (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
 stockSpanner.next(85);  // return 6

 problem:
 There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is target miles away.

 You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).

 A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

 A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

 If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

 Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.
 
 Testcases:
 
 Example 1:
 Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
 The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
 The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
 Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
 
 Example 2:
 Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.
 
 Example 3:
 Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
 Output: 1
 Explanation:
 The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.
 Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
 
 
 Constraints:
 n == position.length == speed.length
 1 <= n <= 105
 0 < target <= 106
 0 <= position[i] < target
 All the values of position are unique.
 0 < speed[i] <= 106

 primary idea:

 primary idea:
 - Use stack and as soon as the current height is lower than earlier, pop all last height's in stack which are higher than current one. calculate area and modify maxArea if needed. After Iteration, check if stack is empty. if not calculate maxArea with all stack elementss
 Time Complexity: O(2n)
 Space Complexity: O(n)
